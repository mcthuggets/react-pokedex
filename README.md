Hello there! 

This is a small project I did for the company facilitating my training. The goal was just to show that I could retrieve data from an API. Here is a link to the PokeAPI v2:

https://pokeapi.co/docs/v2

All it does is load a list of the original 151 Pokemon and shows a sprite from the games when you click their name.

To run the project, type 'npm start' in the terminal ✌️
